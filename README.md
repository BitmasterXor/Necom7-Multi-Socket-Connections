This is a Pascal / Delphi Code example of how to setup a Netcom7 Server socket and have many multiple clients connect to it at the same time and properly manage them in memory.
The Example allows you to listen with the server and have multiple clients connect in and manage them with unique ID's.
You will be able to see and understand how to send to (ONE) selected client or send to (ALL) connected clients in a simple way. 

This project is great for people who are just getting involved with Socket programming in the Pascal / Delphi programming language.
